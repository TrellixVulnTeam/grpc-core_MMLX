[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) core is in the same repo with implements of many languages, which is not convenient for other languages. So I extract the core here. [grpc-elixir](https://github.com/tony612/grpc-elixir) ~~uses it now~~ *is rewritten with pure Elixir*.

Please create issue or PR if you find other files are needed when developing gRPC for a language.
